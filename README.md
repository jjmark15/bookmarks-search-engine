# Bookmarks Search Engine

## Goal
- Create a search engine app that can be configured with a custom list of bookmarks.
- Based on these bookmarks, users should be able to search with keywords
- If a user searches for an unambiguous bookmark then the api should redirect the user to the respective page
- If a user searches for an ambiguous bookmark then the api should return a page with a list of links to the found bookmarks
